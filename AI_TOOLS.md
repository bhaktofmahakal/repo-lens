# AI Tools Used

## Purpose
This file documents how AI tools were used effectively for this project, with clear ownership of decisions.

## Tools and Usage

### 1. GPT-5
- Used for initial boilerplate generation and structured implementation support.
- Helped speed up repetitive setup work for API handlers, typing, and UI composition.
- Used as an assistant, not as an autopilot; project constraints and final decisions were reviewed manually.

### 2. Traycer (Phase Mode)
- Used for planning-phase questioning and architecture decision support.
- Helped break work into execution phases:
  - ingestion
  - retrieval
  - Q&A
  - citations/evidence
  - status/history
  - deployment readiness
- Used to pressure-test tradeoffs before implementation.

### 3. Codex
- Used for codebase-level execution and iterative delivery:
  - editing files
  - fixing bugs
  - writing tests
  - updating docs
  - running validation commands
  - deployment and post-deploy checks
- Used for grounded repo operations and verification, not generic advice only.

### 4. Code-rabbit 
- Used for review the files after commit

## Control and Accountability
- Final architecture and product choices were made with human oversight.
- Code and docs were validated against assignment requirements before submission.
